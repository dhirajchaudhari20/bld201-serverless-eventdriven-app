BLD201 Serverless Event-Driven App

Author: Dhiraj Chaudhari

Project Overview

This repository houses the code for a serverless event-driven application developed by Dhiraj Chaudhari as part of the BLD201 course (replace BLD201 with the actual course name). It leverages serverless technologies to create a scalable and cost-effective solution.

Project Goals

Gain practical experience with serverless architecture principles.
Explore the capabilities of popular serverless platforms (replace with specific platforms used, e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).
Design an event-driven application that reacts to external or internal triggers.
Technologies

Serverless Functions (replace with specific platforms used)
Event Triggers (replace with specific triggers used, e.g., HTTP requests, database changes, message queues)
(Optional) Additional Technologies (list any additional technologies used)
Running the Application

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of serverless development and the chosen platform's deployment process.

Prerequisites:

Install the necessary SDK/CLI tools for the serverless platform.
(Optional, if applicable) Configure any additional environment variables or dependencies.
Deployment:
Refer to the chosen serverless platform's documentation for deployment instructions. Typically, you'll create or update a stack/project definition file and deploy it using the platform's CLI.

Testing:
After deployment, utilize the platform's testing tools or your own test scripts to verify the application's functionality. Refer to event triggers and simulate them to trigger the respective functions.
